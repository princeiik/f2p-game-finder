# F2P Hunt
F2PHunt is a web application I built that allows users to discover free-to-play games based on their preferences. The app is fully responsive, providing an optimized experience across various screen sizes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Tailwind CSS

Frontend: 

For the front end, I integrated the FreeToGame API to fetch video game data and developed a form with dropdown options that allow users to filter games by genre and platform. After users make their selection, it dynamically generates a URL to filter game titles accordingly, ensuring they only see games relevant to their choices. Additionally, I created individual game pages that display detailed information about each game. I also implemented responsive design using Tailwind CSS, ensuring the site works smoothly on small, medium, and large screens.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a project I created while learning React and Tailwind CSS, so it took some time to figure out how to lay out everything. However, having knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript definitely made the process quicker. By the end of the project, while I still have more to learn, it definitely helped me understand the foundations of React. It also deepened my knowledge of working with and manipulating information from APIs as well.
