# F2P Hunt
F2PHunt is a web application I built where users can discover free-to-play games based on their choice. The app is fully responsive, ensuring an optimized experience across different screen sizes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Tailwind CSS

Frontend: 

For the front-end, I integrated the FreeToGame API to fetch video game data and developed a form with dropdown options that allow users to filter games by genre and platform. After users make their selection, it dynamically generate a URL to filter game titles accordingly, ensuring that they only see the games relevant to their choices. Additionally, I created individual game pages that display detailed information about each game. I also implemented responsive design using Tailwind CSS, making sure the site works smoothly on small, medium, and large screens.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a project I created while learning React and Tailwind CSS so it took some time to figure out how I was going to layout everything but having knownledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript definitely made it quicker of course. By the end of the project, while I still have more to learn it definitely helped me understand the foundations of React. It also deepending my knowledge of working and manupulating information with APIs as well
